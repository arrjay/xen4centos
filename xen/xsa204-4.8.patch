Subject: [PATCH] x86/emul: Correct the handling of eflags with SYSCALL

A singlestep #DB is determined by the resulting eflags value from the
execution of SYSCALL, not the original eflags value.

By using the original eflags value, we negate the guest kernels attempt to
protect itself from a privilege escalation by masking TF.

Have the SYSCALL emulation recalculate tf after the instruction is complete.

This is XSA-204
